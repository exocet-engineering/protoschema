# ProtoSchema

ProtoSchema is the coolest JSON Schema 7 to Protobuf 3 definitions encoder.

* It's written in TypeScript and transpiled to Javascript
* The encoder is aware about messages references and will encode them when one is found in the picked schema to be encoded
* The encoded result is separated by namespaces
* You can use `null` on Protobuf 3 with the boolean field flag technique
* You can specify the byte length for numbers and integers
* It's unit tested to be bulletproof
* Zero dependency

```
npm install --save protoschema
```
